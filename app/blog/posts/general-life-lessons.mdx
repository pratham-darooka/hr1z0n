### life lessons 101:

1. **happiness is a choice:**  
   choose it. every. single. day. don't wait for "someday" to be happy. find joy in the little things, even when life gets tough.

2. **relationships are everything:**  
   the harvard study proved it: strong relationships are the key to a long, happy life. nurture your connections with family and friends. they're your support system, your cheerleaders, and your ride-or-dies.

3. **embrace the struggle:**  
   life isn't always rainbows and butterflies. there will be challenges, setbacks, and moments when you want to give up. but it's in those moments that you grow the most. embrace the struggle, learn from it, and come out stronger on the other side.

4. **find your "home":**  
   that unshakeable sense of self-worth, that inner peace that can't be touched by external dramaâ€”that's your "home." it's your foundation, your safe space. build it strong, and no matter what life throws your way, you'll always have a place to come back to.

5. **long-term game strong:**  
   stop chasing short-term gains and start thinking about the big picture. what do you want your life to look like in 5, 10, or even 20 years? set goals, make a plan, and start building the future you want.

6. **skills > stuff:**  
   invest in yourself. learn new skills, develop your talents, and become the best version of yourself. knowledge is power, and skills are your currency in the game of life.

7. **time is your most valuable asset:**  
   don't waste it on things that don't matter. prioritize your time, focus on what's important, and make every moment count.

8. **say "no" more often:**  
   setting boundaries is essential for protecting your time and energy. learn to say no to things that don't align with your values or that drain you.

9. **dress for success:**  
   it's not about being superficial; it's about presenting yourself confidently and feeling good in your own skin. when you look good, you feel good, and when you feel good, you can conquer the world.

10. **own your life:**  
   take responsibility for your choices, your actions, and your life. don't blame others for your mistakes. learn from them, grow from them, and keep moving forward.

11. **never stop learning:**  
   the world is constantly changing, and so should you. embrace lifelong learning, stay curious, and never stop exploring.

12. **find your purpose:**  
   what are you passionate about? what makes you feel alive? find your purpose, and let it guide your decisions and actions.

13. **walk with purpose:**  
   even the smallest actions can have a big impact. walk with intention, speak with clarity, and live with purpose.

14. **enjoy the journey:**  
   life is not a destination; it's a journey. enjoy the ride, appreciate the small moments, and don't take yourself too seriously.

15. **self-care isn't selfish:**  
   it's essential. take care of your physical and mental health. prioritize sleep, eat well, exercise, and do things that make you happy.

16. **forgiveness > permission:**  
   don't wait for permission to pursue your dreams. take risks, break the rules (the good ones, of course), and create your own path.

17. **ignore the haters:**  
   not everyone will support your journey, and that's okay. focus on your own goals, and don't let the negativity of others hold you back.

18. **invest early:**  
   the power of compound interest is real. start investing early, even with small amounts, and watch your money grow over time.

19. **document your journey:**  
   write down your thoughts, your goals, and your progress. it's a great way to reflect on how far you've come and stay motivated.

20. **network like a pro:**  
   connect with people in your industry, build relationships, and learn from others. you never know where a connection might lead.

21. **master the art of sales:**  
   whether you're selling a product, an idea, or yourself, sales skills are essential for success in any field.

22. **work smarter, not harder:**  
   find shortcuts, develop systems, and optimize your workflow. efficiency is key to maximizing your time and energy.

23. **manage your emotions:**  
   don't let your emotions control you. learn to manage your stress, your anxiety, and your anger. emotional intelligence is a superpower.

24. **money can't buy happiness:**  
   it can buy you things, but it can't buy you fulfillment or inner peace. focus on building a life that's rich in experiences, relationships, and purpose.
