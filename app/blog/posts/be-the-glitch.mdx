summary: 'why fit in when you can stand out? time to embrace your glitch mode and be unapologetically *you*!'

**tldr;**  
being the black sheep, the odd one out, or just plain "different" isn't a flaw—it's your superpower. stop trying to blend in. instead, embrace being the glitch in the matrix and own your uniqueness. 💥

you ever feel like you’re the black sheep in your family? or like you just can’t vibe with what everyone else is into? guess what—that’s not a bad thing. in fact, it’s kind of your superpower. being different, standing out, or even straight-up going against the grain is how you’ll carve out your own space in the world. take it from me, an atheist who’s never followed the crowd and doesn’t care what the “norm” is. why? because **the glitch in the matrix is always the one people remember**.

### embrace being the glitch

you know how people copy what’s trending? they see one person doing something cool, and boom—everyone’s doing it. but here's the catch: when you copy just one person, you become a replica. now, imagine taking bits and pieces from 100 different people. what happens? you become something *completely* unique.

don’t worry about fitting into everyone’s expectations. go ahead and be the glitch—the one that messes with the system. because in the long run, it’s the glitches who change the world. 💥

### why being different is your power

look, fitting in is overrated. yeah, it's easy to follow the crowd, but where’s the fun in that? if everyone’s doing the same thing, liking the same stuff, and thinking the same way, nothing new ever happens. being different makes you stand out and lets you think, act, and live in ways that are entirely yours. and trust me—people notice that.

the world is full of clones, and we need more originals. so if you're into things that most people aren’t? good. it means you're not just going with the flow. instead, you're swimming against it, and that takes guts. but it’s also how you end up somewhere amazing.

### copying one vs copying 100

here’s a quick thought experiment:  
imagine you only copy one person—maybe their clothes, their interests, or their beliefs. what happens? you become a near-perfect copy of them, right? but here’s the problem—you’re not adding anything new to the world.

now imagine taking 100 different people, and copying just one thing from each of them. maybe one person’s style, another’s mindset, someone else’s attitude. what do you get? a version of *you* that’s unlike anyone else. you become a glitch in the system—unique, unpredictable, and, most importantly, unapologetically yourself.

so, next time you feel out of place or like you just don’t fit in? remember, **that’s exactly where you’re supposed to be**. be the glitch. after all, nobody remembers the ones who fit in. but the ones who stand out? they leave a mark. 👾
