        I am super interested in finance, particulary the stock market and personal finance.
        I was born and brought up in India, and have also lived in the US for a litle over 5 years.
        I don't really like to talk much about myself and create social media content
        but I am creating this website to share my thoughts and experiences with the world.
        I am a unsocial person and usually pretty lonely. I hope this site helps you find your way.
        Will keep adding more content as I learn more about myself and my journey.
        These blogs would be for my knowledge but will be rephrased using AI - I am not a good writer.`} */}

        financial stuff, particularly the stock market sparks my curiosity, 
        and i also gravitate towards personal finance development,
